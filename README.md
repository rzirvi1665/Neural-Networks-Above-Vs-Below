# Neural Networks that Detect Above Vs. Below

In this research, we investigate the ability of different neural network architectures in detecting above vs. below.

Two experiments were conducted in total. The first tests the ability of neural networks to identify a target shape above or below a constant referent bar; the latter tests the ability to identify a target shape above or below a referent shape. 

The neural networks were programmed in Python using the PyCharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The open-source library TensorFlow and the high-level API Keras were additionally used to train and test the neural networks.
