# Neural Networks that Detect Above Vs. Below

Objective: Test the ability of different neural network architectures in detecting above vs. below.

Two experiments were conducted in total. The first tests the ability of neural networks to identify a target shape above or below a constant referent bar; the latter tests the ability to identify a target shape above or below a referent shape.

Networks tested include Single-Layer Perceptron (SLP), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The neural networks were programmed in Python using the PyCharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The open-source library TensorFlow and the high-level API Keras were additionally used to train and test the neural networks.
