# Neural Networks that Conceptualize Simple Spatial Relationships

In this research, the effect of the type of neural network on the accurate identification of spatial relationships was investigated. 

Two experiments were conducted in total. The first tests the ability of neural networks to identify a target shape above or below a constant referent bar, while the second tests the ability to identify a target shape above or below a referent shape. The neural networks were programmed in Python using the PyCharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The open-source library TensorFlow and the high-level API Keras were additionally used to train and test the neural networks.
